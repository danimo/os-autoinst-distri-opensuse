# Summary: The class introduces all accessing methods for Navigation Panel of
# installation wizard (which is shown in the bottom).
# The panel is extracted to the separate package as all the pages of
# installation wizard contain it, so this allows to reuse its accessing
# functions instead of duplicating them.

# Maintainer: Oleksandr Orlov <oorlov@suse.de>
